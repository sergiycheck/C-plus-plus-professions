You’ll be used to scouring magazines, 
newspapers and Instagram for inspiration on what treatments and looks you could carry out on both friends and clients.
You will also be a pro at knowing what nail polish colours are ‘in’, 
new celebrity hairdos and be able to spot a good set of waxed and tinted ‘brows from afar.
A beauty therapist is a figure that people put their trust into, 
they may reveal body issues that might be embarrassing to them and it’s up to you to maintain their trust and be discreet about their visit.
If you’ve got a strong creative side, then a role as a beauty therapist is perfect for you.
One of the key aspects to this role is being able to keep to your schedule- or at least try to keep as close to it as possible.
Having a career within the beauty industry is one that will constantly involve learning new skills, techniques and new products.
